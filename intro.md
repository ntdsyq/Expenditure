### What this app is meant for

This app provides visualization of US Personal Healthcare trends between 1960 and 2017. Through the interactive graphs in this website you can get a first-hand sense how national health care spending has been growing on an absolute and relative basis, see the relative size of different types of health care expenses, examine the origin of the money used to pay for our health care, and delve into costs at a state level. These trends of course are the results of a multitude of demographic, political and social-economical factors. 

This app could be a useful tool for healthcare professionals, policy makers, and consumers to address various questions, such as: 
+ Is US healthcare spending really exploding over time?
+ What categories are we spending more on?
+ Are consumers paying a bigger share of healthcare cost over time? 
+ What is the financial impact of certain policies and regulations such as the affordable care act?
+ How much variability exist across states in healthcare spending?
+ How has state spending evolved over time?

I hope this will help us gain a deeper understanding of this enduring politically and economically important topic. 

### Source of the data
The underlying data was obtained from the National Health Expenditure Accounts from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and is considered the official estimate for health care expenses. The national data is from 1960 to 2017 while state level data is from 1991 to 2014. Note that the amount of spending is raw dollars and should be interpreted in the context of inflation rate.

I've chosen to focus on "Personal Healthcare Expenditures", the largest category that accounts for 85% of total National Healthcare expenditure in 2017. This is likely the category that will be interesting to most people. It can be broken down into key subcategories such as "Hospital Care", "Physician and Clinical Services", "Prescription Drugs" etc. 

The remaining components of National Healthcare expenditure are mainly indirect expenses, such as the cost of government administration, the net cost of health insurance (i.e. private health insurance administrative expenses and profit), government public health activities, research, and infrastructure investment. These expenses are not analyzed in this app. 

The other dimension for exploration is the source of funding. The major categories are private health insurance, out of pocket cost by consumers, medicaid and medicare. 

### Future Plans 
On the chart by source of funding, add selection of spending category to allow further drill-down. Adjust for inflation by picking for an anchor year.
